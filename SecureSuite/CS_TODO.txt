Release notes, this update

Product Name Considerations
===========================
- Feedback from the NSF, the term "Cloud" leads the user to assume typical cloud capability
yet the product has only a few cloud characterstics.
+ CrypServe, as in CrypSafe
+ Media Server
+ WiFile, short, could work but does not sound secure
+ WiFinder, short, but conflicts with several WiFi "search and find" type apps
+ CrypFileServer, a play on CrypSafe
